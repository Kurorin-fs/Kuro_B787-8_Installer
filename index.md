## How to install this?
double clink and run Kuro_B787-8_Installer.bat and follow the instructions.  

Required Contents :  
MSFS Premium Delux Version (B787-10)  
HeavyDivision's B78XH(any version)

## No Cabin interior?
No.

## No EFB?
No.

## Engine animations are broken (NEW!)
- Update Anim files from the installer.  
(When you switched/updated B78XH to another version, you also need to update FMC/Anim files using the installer)
- The problem is due to a change in the latest B78XH.
My default liveries can be fixed by using installer, but for others, contact the respective livery creator. I cannot fix them.  
(Hint for creators: ASOBO_ENGINE_Turbine_Template->HEAVY_787_ENGINE_Turbine_Template)
## Cockpit lights not working (NEW!)
Remove all light mods from your Community folder.

## I have transparent cockpit (NEW!)
- The B78XH v0.1.15-22(exp)~ is named "B78XH soft fork" and is separated from the Asobo(Default) B787-10. This will apply to Stable and Dev as well.  
If you are using the B78XH soft fork, the previous B787-8 and its liveries are not compatible and the fmc/cockpit will not show up or it cause CTD.  
convert liveries to make it working.  
(If you wanted to go back to "non-soft fork" and use B787-8, ALL the liveries and B787-8 need to be reinstalled)

## Instruments are broken/Screens are black or inop on initial load

(When you switched/updated B78XH to another version, you also need to update FMC/Anim files using the installer)
