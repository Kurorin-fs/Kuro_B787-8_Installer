## How to install this?
double clink and run Kuro_B787-8_Installer.bat and follow the instructions.  

Required Contents :  
MSFS Premium Delux Version (B787-10)  
~~HeavyDivision's B78XH(any version)~~ ; is no longer required since v2.0.0. And if you had used Stable/DEV version, it should be removed.

## No Cabin interior?
No.

## No EFB?
Not yet.
At the earliest, after WT implemented it on the B787-10.

## Camera positioning is wrong
Remove all camera mods from your Community folder.

## Cockpit lights not working
Remove all light mods from your Community folder.

## Instruments are broken/Screens are black or inop on initial load
- (First of all, have you installed MSFS's B787-10?)
- Delete HeavyDivision’s B78XH mod
- Convert liveries from the installer.  
(Btw, Third party liveries are not supported by me.)
- Update B787-10 from Content Manager

## I want to use FTSim+ Sound Pack
Patch it from the Installer.

## Some Sounds are missing
- Disable Custom SoundPack in the Installer and reinstall B787-8
- All Soundpacks released before AAU2 Update(1.33.8.0,  Date: June 23th, 2023) are no longer compatible.
(So if you’re FTSim’ user, you need to update Soundpacks newer than v1.49)

## Everything shows pink
- Update B787-10 from Content Manager / Stop using pirated contents.

## VNAV/LNAV/ILS-Approach is unstable/not follow path.
Adjust Joystick dead-zone setting [20%-50%]
