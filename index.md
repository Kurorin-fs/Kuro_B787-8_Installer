<details><summary><strong>How to install this?</strong></summary>

- double click and run Kuro_B787-8_Installer.bat and follow the instructions.
  
  <strong>Required Contents :</strong>
 - MSFS Premium Delux Version (B787-10)  
 - ~~HeavyDivision's B78XH(any version)~~ ; is no longer required since v2.0.0. And <strong>if you have used Stable/DEV version, it should be removed.</strong>

</details>

<details><summary><strong>File not found error/No windows are shown</strong></summary>
   
- Use [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org) to unpack downloaded zip file. (not WinRAR, it often cause file errors.)

<details><summary><strong>The Installer shows errors during converting liveries</strong></summary>

- Some liveries are incompatible at all, so you'll have to remove them.
  
  How to find incompatible liveries. (v2.0.0 Installer):  
  The cmd shows "Scanned: XXXX/SimObjects/~" just before the error.  
  Delete the folder with the same name as that XXXX from the Community.  
  I'm unable to assist you in this matter.   
  If this does not resolve the issue, delete all 788 liveries from Community. (Note that I do not support Third-Party liveries.)
    
  (So, for example, in the below SS case, it is the "Community/Kuro_B787-8_TESTING" folder that needs to be deleted.)
